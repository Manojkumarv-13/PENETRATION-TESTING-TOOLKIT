DESCRIPTION :
The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a modular and command-line driven cybersecurity project built in Python. Its purpose is to simulate key aspects of ethical hacking and vulnerability assessment, allowing users to test networks, services, and credentials for potential weaknesses. This toolkit includes multiple independent modules such as a Port Scanner, SSH Brute Forcer, and Banner Grabber, providing users with a hands-on introduction to penetration testing techniques.

The project is structured around the principle of modularity. Each function resides in its own file, and a central script (main.py) serves as the toolkit’s launcher. This allows for scalable development and easy maintenance. Users can select which module to run through a simple menu-driven interface, making the toolkit both beginner-friendly and efficient for quick tasks.

The Port Scanner module uses Python’s socket library to scan for open TCP ports on a target machine. By iterating over a range of common ports and attempting TCP connections, the scanner identifies which ports are open and potentially vulnerable. This module is essential for identifying active services that can be probed further.

The SSH Brute Forcer demonstrates how attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access by guessing credentials. This module leverages the paramiko library to try multiple passwords from a given wordlist against an SSH server. Although the tool is built for educational purposes, it highlights the importance of strong password policies and intrusion detection mechanisms.

The Banner Grabber connects to a service (default port 80) and sends a simple HTTP request to retrieve the server’s response header. This banner can contain useful information like the web server type and version—data that can be critical for identifying known exploits and misconfigurations.

The toolkit is designed for ethical use, particularly in labs, test environments, or with permission from system owners. It does not contain destructive features or zero-day exploits, making it a safe and legal way to practice ethical hacking and penetration testing concepts.

All modules are implemented using built-in or easily installable libraries. The code is lightweight, well-documented, and adaptable, encouraging users to expand it with additional features like directory brute-forcing, SQL injection testing, or vulnerability database integration.

Interns who complete this project gain valuable experience in Python programming, network protocols, and cybersecurity fundamentals. They also learn how to handle sockets, create secure connections, parse server responses, and manage multi-file Python applications. Upon successful completion and submission, participants will be awarded a Completion Certificate by CodTech, validating their practical knowledge and skills in penetration testing.

This project serves as both a learning platform and a foundational toolset for those pursuing careers in ethical hacking, network security, or cybersecurity analysis.
